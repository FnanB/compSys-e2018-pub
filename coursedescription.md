# Course Description

This course is a general introduction to computer systems. You will learn how computers works at a basic but fundamental level and how this reflects to the programs that you write. We will cover topics from Machine architecture, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, and basic Security. We will also introduce you to the C programming language, which will be used throughout the course.

(For some reason, it is easier to find maps with Folkeuniversitet than KU.)

## Study ambassadors and cafés

On most Fridays from 14 to 16 there will be study cafés in which you can get help with the material and assignments. The cafés will be serviced by the Study Ambassadors: Jeppe Werner Laursen and Kristian Bøjer Andreasen. Cafés are held in DIKU 1-0-04, 1-0-10 and 1-0-18.

## Assignment

There are 8 assignment in total during the course with deadline roughly every second week with the following deadlines.

|                                   | Expected deadline   |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| A0: Getting started with file(1)  | 09 Sep @ 10:00AM    |
| A1: file(1) - Unicode             | 23 Sep @ 10:00AM    |
| A2: Simulering af x86 delmængde   | 07 Oct @ 10:00AM    |
| A3: Programopførsel               | 28 Oct @ 10:00AM    |
| A4: Processes                     | 11 Nov @ 10:00AM    |
| A5: Concurrent Programming        | 02 Dec @ 10:00AM    |
| A6: Computer Networking - 1       | 16 Dec @ 10:00AM    |
| A7: Computer Networking - 2       | 06 Jan @ 10:00AM    |

The deadlines (including hand-in time) in Block 1 have been coordinated with the MASD course.

The assignments will be graded with points from 0 to 4 and it is not possible to re-hand-in any of the assignments.

Assignments are made to be solved in groups of preferably three students, but groups of two active students will also do. We strongly encourage not to work alone. Groups cannot be larger than three students. Each Group must make their own solutions and cannot share implementations and report with other. You can discuss material and ideas.

### Feedback
Feedback to assignments will be given by TAs on the course. It will be given written and can be expected about two weeks after the hand-in. Feedback will focus on what could be approved in the assignment relating to both technical implementations, and report structure and material. The feedback may thus be useful for later assignment. Feedback will not give a direct justification of the evaluation in number of points.

## Exam qualification

To qualify for the exam you are required to achieve at least 50 % of the total number of points in the assignments. A0 and A1 is in total considered the same size as the following assignments: this means that points given in A0 is weighted 1/3 while A1 is weighted 2/3.

Furthermore, we will require that you a reasonable understanding of all parts (ARK, OS, CN) of the assignments. This is firstly interpreted as achieving points at least 40 % points in each the of topics. To optimise your understanding of the course, and since all assignments are in the syllabus, we encourage you to work with and hand in all sets.

Mapping of topics to assignments:

|                      | A0 | A1 | A2 | A3 | A4 | A5 | A6 | A7 |
| ---------------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Machine architecture |    |    |  X |  X |    |    |    |    |
| Operating System     |    |    |    |    |  X |  X |    |    |
| Computer network     |    |    |    |    |    |    |  X |  X |

The rule about 40 % of points for assignments in each topic, is included to make sure that you will uphold the learning goals for the course. We will teach you about many different abstractions and you should learn something about all of them. Without this rule you could attend the exam without e.g. learning anything about computer networks by getting enough points in the beginning of the course. The 40 % is chosen as it should be "easier" than the general rule of 50 %; it will therefore be set to 3 of the possible 8 points.


## Exam

The exam is a written 4-hour exam and will be held on Wednesday Jan 23.

The course syllabus is the exercises and reading material.

We will later publish example sets based on the previous exam iteration.

It will be possible to get limited feedback on the exam performance.
