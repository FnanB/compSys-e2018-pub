## Socket Programming Understanding Session

* Understand socket interface (repeated from last exercise session)
  * Read man pages of socket, bind, connect, listen, accept, read and write. 
  * hostinfo example code (Fig 11.17 BOH page 977)
  * open_clientfd code (Fig 11.18 BOH page 979)
  * open_listenfd code (Fig 11.19 BOH page 981)
  * Echo client/iterative server example code (Fig 11.20 - 11.22 BOH page 982-983)
  * Using the wrapper functions is optional but they simplify programming a lot

* Understand different concurrent server implementations
  * Process-based echo server (Fig 12.5 BOH page 1012)
  * Iterative (Fig 12.6 BOH page 1015) and concurrent echo server (Fig 12.8 - 12.11 BOH page 1018 - 1020) based on I/O multiplexing
  * Thread-based echo server (Fig 12.14 BOH page 1027)
  * Pre-threaded echo server (Fig 12.28 BOH page 1047)

* (*Optional*) Look at the code snippets of the tiny web server implementation (Fig 11.29 - 11.35 BOH page 993 - 999)
